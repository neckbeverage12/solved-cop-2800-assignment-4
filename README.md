This is a simplified minesweeper game.  The player moves from the starting position on the board to the finish without stepping on a bomb.

Your program must work like thisâ€¦

<ol>

 <li>Player starts in upper left</li>

 <li>Player moves one space at a time</li>

 <li>Player can only move <strong>right</strong> or <strong>down</strong>. Ignore any other input.</li>

 <li>Player cannot move off the board</li>

 <li>Player wins when he/she reaches lower right corner</li>

 <li>Player loses if he/she steps on a bomb</li>

 <li>Your program should prompt for the size of the board. Ensure that input is at least size 3. Place one bomb for a 3X3 board. Add an additional bomb for each row above 3.</li>

 <li>Bombs must be placed <strong>randomly</strong>. Your instructor will check this thoroughly.</li>

 <li>Insure that bombs are not placed at the start or the finish.</li>

 <li>Game board should be printed out in a user friendly fashion at the start and after each move, except the last. Since you are doing this as a homework exercise rather than a real game, your board display should <strong>show where the bombs are</strong>.  This will make it easier for your instructor to grade your program.</li>

</ol>
